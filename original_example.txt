External: [location]
Internal: Thank you, Miss [name]. How can I help you, ma'am?
External: So I already asked, told you how you can help me after you asking 10 questions. I'm sorry to get an attitude, but you asked your questions and you didn't even wonder what mine was. I need the balance on my account, please.
Internal: Sure ma’am. I'm sorry, this was only for verification process. So this account is by the full lis agreement.
External: Girl, you don't have to keep telling me that. I've heard you 4 times.
Internal: Everything is in the contract, Miss … I can send you a copy of the list.
External: I don't have it with me right now, ma'am. Gosh… yeah, send me the contract again, please.
Internal: Sure, give me one moment.
Internal: Everything is in the contract, miss. You didn't complete the early purchase option. Normally the account passes by the full lease agreement.
Internal: Okay, I already sent the contract, ma'am. That's where it shows all the payments about the leasing fees. So basically, you're missing four more payments, so you can complete your balance.
External: Alright.

Conversation 8
External: Hello.
Internal: Hello, my name is [name]. I’m calling back in response to your voicemail. How can I help you?
External: I’m confused why I’m being charged over $1000 more than what we bought.
External: We bought something for $800 using OKennis, but now it’s almost $1800.
Internal: Let me check. Can I have the phone number associated with your account?
External: [phone]
Internal: May I have your first and last name?
External: [name]
Internal: Thanks. Can you confirm your full address?
External: [address, zip]
Internal: And your place of employment?
External: [company]
Internal: Email address?
External: [user info]
Internal: Thank you. Your balance is currently $309.20, with two payments left.
External: But the original purchase was $800 — where is the extra $1000 coming from?
Internal: Because you didn’t pay the $800 before November 3, 2024, the contract converted to full lease terms.
External: But we never received the contract. We were told it would auto-deduct.
Internal: I’m sorry. I’ll send you the contract now.
External: It’s too late — the $1000 is gone.
Internal: You could have called us earlier to clarify.
External: So it’s just $1000 of late charges?
Internal: It’s not late charges — it’s because of the leasing agreement terms.
External: This feels like a scam.
Internal: All this is on the contract.
External: A contract we never received.
Internal: You could always request it.
External: So nothing can be done?
Internal: I’m sorry. Is there anything else I can help you with?
External: No.
Internal: Thank you for calling. Bye.
External: Bye.
