CONVERSATION 1 :
00:02	External	 	Hello.
00:06	External	 	Hello.
00:19	External	 	Hello.
00:26	Internal	 	Hello, my name is. I'm giving you a call and record, receive a voicemail from your request, and call back. So, I would like to know, how can I help you?
00:34	External	 	Yeah, so looking at
00:39	External	 	my like account statements and stuff, I am confused why I'm being charged $1000 over what we actually bought
00:52	External	 	using O Kennis, So that's why I'm calling because it seems
01:01	External	 	really ridiculous.
01:08	Internal	 	Okay, well if this information was in your concern, basically, now, bud, let me just a moment before I can open your account. May I have the phone number that is associated to the account? Because with the phone number that you are calling, I couldn't find an account.
01:21	External	 	Yeah, it's [phone]
01:46	Internal	 	Okay, may I have your first and last name?
01:50	External	 	[name]
01:55	Internal	 	That is your name.
01:57	External	 	…
02:02	Internal	 	Okay,
02:04	Internal	 	thank you Miss [name] Now can you confirm, help me to confirm some information on the account just for security purposes? First of all, may I please have your complete address?
02:13	External	 	[location] [postal code]
02:33	Internal	 	Thank you. May I have your place of employment?
02:37	External	 	[name] Supply.
02:44	Internal	 	Thank you. And the last time I have your email address,
02:47	Internal	 	yes?
02:47	External	 	[user info]
03:01	Internal	 	Thanks … lot. Thank you so much for damn. Okay, so well, basically, I'm looking here on the account. The balance at this moment is of $309.20 right you have two payments left.
03:15	External	 	Okay, yeah, but the thing is, is that we bought something for $800 and we're being charged by the end of it, nearly $1800 over $1000 over what we bought. So where is that $1000 going? And why are we being charged?
03:21	Internal	 	Oh.
03:35	External	 	That because we cannot view the contract because whenever we download it, it's just an empty pdf that you cannot view.
03:45	External	 	So that's where I'm trying to figure out where this thousand dollars is going.
03:50	External	 	It should have been paid off six months ago.
03:50	Internal	 	Oh yeah, well Miss [name] basically I apologize for that but that $800 was supposed to be paid before November the 3rd 2024 and you didn't. So basically once you doesn't pay that balance before the last date, you will be in the full agreement of the contract but paying a balance more higher. All this information was on your contract
04:10	Internal	 	also.
04:11	External	 	Yeah, but we never got the contract that was not explained to us. So the thousand dollars is disappearing to where?
04:15	Internal	 	Oh well, I can be more than glad to help you to send it right now.
04:20	Internal	 	So let me just one moment. I will send it right now.
04:21	External	 	Okay, but it doesn't do any good anymore because the thousand dollars is gone. We were not told that the contract never came through. We thought that what was explained to us was that it would draft out and it would just automatically pay itself off.
04:39	Internal	 	No, that was not like that. I apologies for that they were supposed to call us also you always have that option to to give us a call to know more information about this account but this is the first time that you call us actually.
04:52	Internal	 	Okay, so I will send you the contract right now. Send the documents
04:58	Internal	 	of your contact.
04:59	External	 	So where does the thousand dollars get?
05:02	Internal	 	On this.
05:02	External	 	It just goes straight to you guys, and you just get you just keep it.
05:06	Internal	 	No, all this all like before this is on your contract, so right, right, once you read the contract, you will,
05:14	Internal	 	… know basically
05:16	Internal	 	what happened with the early purchase option that you was having that like I coming before that $800 was supposed to be paid before November the 3rd 2034. So you didn't,
05:26	Internal	 	you … the full agreement of the contract. I'm sending you the document of your contract.
05:38	External	 	And on my end, it does not say $300. It says remaining balance is two thirty one. So
05:45	Internal	 	Oh yeah, that is your pay off balance if you would like to pay off the account today. For example, if you would like to pay … the account today, it is $231.91 But that is just if you would like to pay off the account. It's like a discount for you to pay out the account.
06:02	Internal	 	So everything is a copy of your … Miss [name]
06:02	External	 	Okay, so you guys,
06:07	External	 	so there's just, that's just the way that it is. It's just $1000 more because
06:14	External	 	it wasn't paid off,
06:18	External	 	so it's A 100% interest, essentially.
06:23	Internal	 	… basically, this is now Enter. It's like listing charges.
06:28	External	 	Late charges, $1000 of late charges.
06:30	Internal	 	No, listen, listen, charges.
06:40	External	 	Okay,
06:41	External	 	so pretty much, it's just a scam.
06:45	Internal	 	No, because all this information is on the contract, miss.
06:57	External	 	A contract that we never received. It was supposed to be emailed to us.
07:00	Internal	 	They … supposed to call us. If you didn't the … you can always call us.
07:05	Internal	 	Request also that.
07:12	External	 	Okay, so there's just, that's just it. There's nothing,
07:22	External	 	so not
07:24	External	 	okay. Alright, well, that's no help at all, and it's really crappy to do that, but
07:31	External	 	I guess that's what it is then.
07:34	Internal	 	Okay, I apologize for this. So, is there anything else I can do you today?
07:37	External	 	No.
07:39	Internal	 	Excellent, I hope and thank you for calling. Bye bye.

01:03	Internal	 	No problem.
01:04	External	 	I'm putting you on speaker one second.

01:08	Internal	 	And also, Miss [name] I do wanna let you know the call is recorded and monitored. And while I have you on the line, may you verify the home address and email for verification purposes?
01:15	External	 	Yeah
01:20	External	 	I don't know what email I got cause I got some emails Which one that I have
01:23	Internal	 	We have the Gmail.
01:24	External	 	Which one I have two, so which one do you have?
01:27	Internal	 	Yes, ma'am. So now with with verifying it you can just give me the ones you have and I can tell you the one we got on file.
01:35	External	 	Okay, my address is [location]
01:39	External	 	and I don't know if you get the let it, I don't know which one you have.

01:50	External	 	Happy at home.
01:52	Internal	 	Yes, ma'am. Thank you for verifying that information for me.
01:55	External	 	Okay I I think it probably clash because my what's name is due my internet is due on the 8th, so it probably just slashed off
02:07	External	 	at all.
02:09	External	 	It probably slashed off
02:13	External	 	because my internet bill is due. That's probably what happened. So what I need to do go up to the office and pay the how much do the how much to do
02:22	Internal	 	Okay so to take care of the [card expiry date] payment and the return fee it'll be $99.78 we can schedule it with the checkings account on file and again [card number] Or we can use the debit card that's on file. I'm sorry, the Mastercard end again [card number] Whichever you prefer.
02:39	External	 	I'm not gonna have anything on that card until
02:43	External	 	the [card expiry date] so I think I have eighty something dollars on another card,
02:51	External	 	so that wouldn't be now.
02:53	External	 	[card number]
02:56	External	 	…
02:58	External	 	I thought my bill was eighty something dollars. That's what, because it's late.
03:01	Internal	 	No ma'am, now technically the regular payment is only $69.78 but being that you had a payment to return it cost a $25 return fee on the account plus a $5 reinstatement fee so that's why it's the ninety nine seventy eight
03:16	External	 	But it was ninety something dollars the first time I took off my card within a week of me
03:20	External	 	paying the six hundred some dollars. Ya took ninety some dollars off my card a week later at the box of Francis.
03:26	Internal	 	Yes ma'am because you have a one time documented process a fee of $22.05 that was added to your regular payment so was for $91.83
03:37	External	 	Okay, I do nothing in the contract to see if that, and then y'all took the $97 in next week too.
03:40	Internal	 	Oh yes ma'am, it's listed on the first page contract.
03:43	External	 	Okay I hear what you're saying no no no no you know I didn't sit there in that front the store I said he he sit there for been at three hours
03:50	External	 	and it should have s three hours to get no furniture but yeah so you know I didn't sit there and read that whole contract and that whole thing I to sit there for three hours trying to get approved and I got approved four thousand, but I still pay $650. But you know [location] to trying to get approved for three hours. You know, the whole thing after to sitting there for three hours
04:09	External	 	first and foremost, second of all, let's pull up further than that. Y'all cut ninety some dollars after I pay for $50 the next week,
04:16	External	 	… put me behind on my internet bill, which is the reason why they run together now
04:22	External	 	… they didn't supposed to run together has I … ninety some dollars then next week and I thought I was … have to pay the $97 in next month
04:29	External	 	and I didn't. … … it the next week that to make some bills have to run together now.
04:36	External	 	I don't think they speak.
04:36	Internal	 	Yes, ma'am,
04:38	Internal	 	and I do apologize for the inconvenience. Now, as far as the regular payment with the one time documented processing fee. And I understand you stated that you know, you didn't have time to read the contract. But the information was listed on the contract.
04:53	Internal	 	And then I go ahead. I'm sorry.
04:53	External	 	What, what I'm saying is what I'm trying to get … is if I paid for the furniture that month,
05:00	External	 	why would I have to pay that bill that month too.
05:04	Internal	 	Okay, so your first payment was in March. That's the only payment that you was due for. Now, whatever you paid at the store is between you and the store. We only go by the contract that they send over to.
05:16	External	 	Okay I I hear what you're saying that the payment I paid in the store was six fifty
05:22	External	 	that was my bill for that month, I thought
05:26	External	 	and y'all turn around a second. I got the front of the house then next week can took ninety something dollars.
05:31	Internal	 	Yes, ma'am. So what I'm guessing you did because you say that you paid six fifty at the store.
05:37	External	 	Yeah, … the six fifty seven fifth.
05:37	Internal	 	So what they did,
05:39	Internal	 	yeah, so basically, what they did, they just took that off of your cash price. They only sign in your cash price of $350.
05:48	External	 	I got a receipt right here in my first bed.
05:55	Internal	 	Cause I'm looking at the initial dial payment that you made was $55.07
06:01	External	 	No beg its right …
06:04	Internal	 	Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So, if you made a payment at the store that was between you and the store, what they did was probably took it off and sent over just the remaining balance that you had to pay, which was the $350.
06:19	Internal	 	Well, of course along with that three fifty you have an early payoff fee which is $59.95 and of course the total sales tax on the account was $42.02
06:30	External	 	See, it's a cash amount down here. $600.
06:34	Internal	 	Okay, well, the cash price that we got was six fifty. I'm sorry, three fifty. I'm sorry, it was $350. Your cash price was $350. That's the
06:44	Internal	 	… the lease agreement.
06:44	External	 	… how much they trying to pay at all
06:47	Internal	 	Right now, you only owe $410.14 and then
06:50	External	 	I don't … … $100 booking.
06:53	Internal	 	Ma'am, it's included in your April 11th payment
06:57	Internal	 	not had due … care of the April 11th payment. It'll go down a bit, but this fourteen fourteen includes the $25 return fee, the $5 late fee and of course the $69.78 that was technically due for April 11th.
07:10	External	 	Okay, listen,
07:12	External	 	I'm sorry, when I left your store, I mean, when I left the store, I owed it $300. I mean 200 and
07:19	External	 	the … was $100
07:22	External	 	and I paid $650.
07:25	External	 	I mean, I forgot it was $950
07:28	External	 	again.
07:29	External	 	And if I pay $600.
07:31	Internal	 	Alright, they'll left you with the three fifty.
07:34	External	 	Exactly, that's how much I owe it three fifty.
07:36	Internal	 	Right, but like I was just explaining to you, the cash price was sent over for three fifty
07:41	Internal	 	your early purchase option of a 90 days you have a 90 day pay off fee which was $59.95 and the total sales tax on the account was $42.02
07:52	Internal	 	Now at this time only one payment has been made because you're April the 11th payment, which would have been your second payment returned.
08:03	External	 	…
08:04	External	 	okay, so if I pay this
08:07	External	 	bill, you're speaking of today because you all double charged me in one week, which I did not understand. I mean, how that even went
08:17	External	 	if I pay this bill in the next couple of days,
08:22	External	 	how much do I owe ya there
08:25	External	 	cause I don't see how I I'm gonna owe you extra money if I paid him
08:30	External	 	$600.
08:31	Internal	 	Right, you stated for yourself that the cash price was nine something, correct?
08:35	External	 	Correct, just on the receipt.
08:36	Internal	 	Okay,
08:37	Internal	 	and you stated that you gave him six something at the store?
08:40	External	 	Correct, that's on a receipt.
08:42	Internal	 	Right, so that's why they signed up with the cash price of the three fifty.
08:46	Internal	 	But along with the cash price, you have the taxes and the fees. And only one payment has been made so far. So that's why it looks like you haven't paid anything because you still have that payment to take care of for April the 11th.
08:46	External	 	Huh,
09:00	External	 	okay. If I pay in the next couple of days?
09:04	Internal	 	Okay, so let's see. You do on the 11th.
09:05	External	 	How much would I owing?
09:10	External	 	I … he's reading.
09:11	Internal	 	I'm calculating it for you.
09:24	External	 	Okay.
09:24	Internal	 	14.
09:26	External	 	$845.
09:28	Internal	 	Alright, if you go ahead and take care of the payment for the $99.78 that's gonna leave you with a balance of $310.36
09:35	Internal	 	And you'll have until June 8th to have the account closed out completely before you actually enter into the full release agreement.
09:42	External	 	I'm trying to see how do I owe that much if I only owed three something when I left the store.
09:49	Internal	 	Okay, like I advised you, you have a cash price of $350
09:54	Internal	 	plus your $59.95 payoff fee and the total sales tax which was $42.02 that brought your balance of $451.97 you've only made one regular payment which is $69.78
10:13	Internal	 	Now being that you had a payment to return, we had to add an additional $25 plus the $5 reinstatement fee that's technically $412.19 that you owe but we giving you the option to pay the fourteen fourteen that is the complete balance as of to date now the only thing that you're responsible for at this time is your April the 11th payment
10:33	Internal	 	because that's the payment they returned
10:37	Internal	 	which is the $99.78 that includes all taxes and fees for April the 11th.
10:48	Internal	 	Do you have a copy of your original lease agreement or do you just have the stores copy … I can send you a copy of the full lease agreement that you signed.
10:56	External	 	Could just send in my email, please.
10:58	Internal	 	Yes, ma'am. Let me go ahead and get that … over to you now … I know you stated you didn't read it, so I do understand.
11:03	External	 	I was in the store for 3 hours. Just trying to get 1 bed, and that was outside. I already picked my bed and I was sending in there for three hours trying to get this stuff to go through.
11:10	Internal	 	Yeah and that's that's that's the weird part about it cause technically you signed the contract first before you even do all of that but I'm gonna to go ahead and send it to you.
11:16	External	 	Yeah,
11:19	External	 	maybe our system was down. Their system was down and I went to two different companies trying to get through to ya system It was a whole bunch of mess. I was sitting there for three hours.
11:25	Internal	 	…
11:33	External	 	I would have never agreed to pay an extra $500 and some change more than with the fricking bill. Was actually freaking worse. I don't want with the one that was $500. One had to pay that right out right then.
11:43	Internal	 	If you can check your email for me, miss, let I went ahead and sent you that lease agreement. We can go through it together just in case you don't understand. I can answer any questions or concerns for you.
11:51	External	 	That's ridic
11:55	External	 	… this one … d right now I'm feeling … away
12:02	External	 	I do not like it. I do not like it at all
12:39	External	 	and don't see, I don't like this $350. I get stop
12:42	External	 	that's really upset me and I know I left it. It was six hundred some dollars. That's really upset me right there in itself.
12:47	Internal	 	Right, but you stated that altogether. It was nine something. So if you're paying six something that is gonna leave you with a balance of three something.
12:55	External	 	I'm trying to see how if I pay six.
12:58	Internal	 	Ma'am, you stated for yourself that the merchandise was not. How much was the merchandise? Nine, how much?
13:04	External	 	Fifty.
13:06	Internal	 	Nine fifty right?
13:08	External	 	Huh.
13:08	Internal	 	How much did you pay him at the store?
13:11	External	 	Fix that.
13:12	Internal	 	Do you remember the exact amount?
13:14	External	 	It's on the receipt. It's rang in my bank in my first.
13:17	Internal	 	Okay, so how much did you give him?
13:20	External	 	…
13:21	Internal	 	Six hundred even
13:25	Internal	 	if you gave him 600 even, that leaves you with $350.
13:30	External	 	… I gave them 600. I gave him 600 email.
13:30	Internal	 	Your cash price,
13:32	Internal	 	yes ma'am. And they sign a cash price open for $350
13:38	Internal	 	along with the three fifty. You have the $59.95 early purchase payoff fee and the total sales tax $42.02
13:47	Internal	 	that was a total of $451.97
13:48	External	 	Oh.
14:03	Internal	 	If it was nine fifty and you gave him six, that leaves you with three fifty
