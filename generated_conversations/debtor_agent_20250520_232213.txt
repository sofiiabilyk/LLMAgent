Internal: Thank you for calling. How can I help you today?
 External:Yeah, I need to know why my balance is showing higher than expected. Can you explain that?
 internal says:Sure, let me just verify your account details. May I have your reference code, please? Once I have that, I can explain why your balance is showing higher than expected.
 External:Yeah, it's [reference code].
 internal says:Thank you for providing your reference code. Let me just take a moment to look up your account details. Please hold on.
 External:Alright, so what's the balance now? Like, after all this, what do I actually owe?
 internal says:Sure, thank you for your patience. After reviewing your account details, your current balance is showing as $1,250. This amount includes some late fees and interest charges that have accrued over time. Would you like me to explain the breakdown of these charges?
 External:Alright, break it down for me. How much of that is late fees and interest? I need to know exactly what I'm paying for.
 internal says:Alright, let me break it down for you. Out of the $1,250, $200 are late fees and $150 are interest charges. The rest is the principal amount. Would you like to discuss payment options to settle this balance?
 External:So after all these charges, what s the final amount I need to pay to clear this up? I just want to get it done.
 internal says:The final amount you need to pay to clear everything up is One Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Dollars. This includes all the principal, late fees, and interest charges. Would you like to discuss payment options to settle this balance?
 External:Okay, I'll pay it, but this whole thing just seems like a rip-off. Can you at least waive some of those fees?
 internal says:I understand your concern about the fees. Unfortunately, these fees are part of the agreement terms, and we must adhere to them. However, I can offer you a payment plan to help manage the balance more comfortably. Would you like to discuss the available options?
 External:Alright, but this whole thing just feels like a scam. I mean, I get the payment plan, but those fees are just ridiculous. Is there really no way to cut them down a bit?
 internal says:I understand your frustration, and I'm here to help clarify things for you. While I can't waive the fees, I can offer a payment plan to make it more manageable for you. Given your balance of One Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Dollars, you can opt for a one-time payment or a short-term payment plan of up to six months. Would you like to discuss these options further?
 External:Yeah, yeah, I get it. Just email me the payment plan details and I'll look it over. But seriously, these fees are just too much.
 internal says:Alright, I understand your frustration with the fees. Unfortunately, these fees are part of the agreement terms, and we must adhere to them. However, to assist you better, I can offer a payment plan to help manage the balance more comfortably. Would you like to discuss the available options?
External:Yeah, yeah, just send the details over, and I'll see what I can do. But seriously, these fees are just ridiculous.
